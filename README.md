# Decision Tree from Scratch

A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome or class label. The decision tree algorithm recursively partitions the data based on the feature values to create the tree and make predictions.
Implementing a decision tree from scratch allows us to understand the core concepts, such as splitting criteria, tree construction, pruning, and prediction. It also provides flexibility in customizing the algorithm and handling specific requirements.

The decision tree algorithm involves the following key steps:

* Selecting the best feature: Determine the splitting criteria to find the feature that best separates the data based on some measure of impurity or information gain. Common measures include Gini Index, Information Gain, or Entropy.
* Creating decision nodes: Once the best feature is chosen, create a decision node in the tree and split the data based on the feature's values.
* Recursion: Recursively apply the splitting process to each partitioned subset of data until a stopping criterion is met. This may include reaching a maximum tree depth, a minimum number of samples per leaf, or other defined conditions.
* Assigning class labels: Once a leaf node is reached, assign a class label or value based on the majority class or average value of the samples in that leaf.
* Pruning (optional): Perform pruning techniques such as post-pruning or pre-pruning to reduce overfitting and improve the decision tree's generalization ability.

### Implementation
Implementing a decision tree from scratch involves coding the above steps in Python. The implementation includes constructing the tree, making predictions, and optionally incorporating pruning techniques.

The decision tree code should provide functions for training the tree on the dataset, evaluating its performance, and making predictions on new data points.

### Usage
To use the decision tree implementation, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset: Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted and preprocessed. Split it into training and testing sets if required.
Import the decision tree module or script into your Python project.
Train the decision tree: Call the appropriate function or methods to train the decision tree using the training dataset.
Evaluate the decision tree: Assess the performance of the decision tree by using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error, depending on the task.
Make predictions: Apply the trained decision tree to new, unseen data points to predict their corresponding class labels or target variable values.
Optionally, perform pruning: If implemented, apply pruning techniques to refine the decision tree and improve its generalization ability.
